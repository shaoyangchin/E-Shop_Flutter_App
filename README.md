## Online E-Shop Mobile Application
An online shopping app with backend Firebase configured. Users are able to view all available products to order and add the ones they like to their favorites as well. Users will then be able to add the cart and order the desired items, and the Server would receive these data, such that the vendors can ship out the order based on the details given by the user customer.
